    Vinland saga, THE ANIME review. I like to do these everyonce in a while, today I had just finished season 2 of vinland saga, I thought I won't like it
    as much as the first season because I loved the violence in the show but god damn, The show made me get really excited about all the killing 
    and the action and all the battles, then in season 2 it taught me that violence is not the way to go and made me grow along with our main character Thorfinn,
    Son of Thors. But fear not for the lovers of Vinland saga There is yet more to come. WE HAVE NO ENEMIES.
