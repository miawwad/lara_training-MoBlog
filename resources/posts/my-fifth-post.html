<p>
    Today on our journey to palestine, the land of god. it all started with the travels, it was quite difficult to enter palestine which was denied their own airport, so to feel 
    what it is like to be them we travelled the same route they do, instead of going to tel Aviv, the roads where quite difficult and inhuman, bags were split wide open
    thoroughly searched and thrown away. israel borders kept taking breaks and torturing people in this insuffereable hot weather and they did that knowingly.
    after 8 hours of suffereing we had finally landed in jericho the lowest point on earth neighouring the dead sea, which the palestinians had no access to.
    and from their we took public transport to Ramallah, one of palestines biggest and livelyiest cities.
